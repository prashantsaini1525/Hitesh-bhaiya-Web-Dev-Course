# Section 3: Basics of Web Development

## Lecture: How Does the Internet Work?

---

## 1. Key Idea

The Internet is simply the ability to connect one computer to another. Behind this, there is a lot of engineering that makes the connection smooth and fast.

**Hinglish Recall:** Internet = ek computer ka doosre computer se connect hona. Simple idea hai, lekin peeche engineering mast hai.

## 2. IP Address

- Every computer on the internet is identified by a unique **IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.2.5`).
- Humans cannot remember numbers easily, so we use **domain names** instead.

**Hinglish Recall:** Har computer ka ek IP hota hai. Par humko numbers yaad karna mushkil hai, isliye names use karte hain jaise google.com.

---

## 3. Domain Name System (DNS)

- **DNS = Phonebook of the Internet.**
- Converts domain names (e.g., `chaicode.com`) into IP addresses.
- ISP (Airtel, Jio, AT&T) first checks DNS to find the actual IP.

**Hinglish Recall:** DNS = Internet ka phonebook. Naam ko IP mein convert karta hai.

---

## 4. ISP (Internet Service Provider)

- ISP provides internet (Airtel, Jio, etc.).
- When you type a website, your ISP contacts DNS to find the IP.

**Hinglish Recall:** ISP tumhe net deta hai, aur DNS se poochta hai ki website ka IP kya hai.

---

## 5. Hosting

- You _can_ host a website on your own computer (since it has an IP).
- Problem: Computer must run 24/7.
- Solution: Use hosting providers like **Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, Linode**.

**Hinglish Recall:** Apne PC par host kar sakte ho, par 24/7 chalana padega. Isliye log hosting services lete hain.

---

## 6. Deployment

- After making a website → deploy it on cloud hosting → available to millions.
- This makes your site accessible anytime.

**Hinglish Recall:** Project banao → Hosting par daalo → Sabko dikhne lagega.

---

## 7. Chrome DevTools (Inspect → Network Tab)

- Shows how requests and responses work.
- You can check headers, response, request method, timing, cache, payload, etc.
- Helps to debug and understand what’s happening behind the scenes.

**Hinglish Recall:** Inspect → Network tab se dekh sakte ho ki website background mein kya request/response kar rahi hai.

---

## Quick Summary

- Internet = Connection between computers.
- Each computer has **IP address**.
- DNS = Converts names → IP.
- ISP = Middleman, connects you to DNS & websites.
- Hosting providers keep websites live 24/7.
- Deployment = Making your site available to everyone.
- DevTools = Inspect and debug network activity.

✅ With this, Internet is no more a mystery — it’s just **connections + addresses + hosting**.
